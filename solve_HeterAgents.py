# Computational Method
# developed by Thomas Winberry (2018), "A Method for Solving and Estimating Heterogeneous Agent Macro Models"
# Step 1: Approximate value function & distribution using finite-dimensional global approximations w.r.t. individual state variables
# Step 2: Compute the stationary eqm. of the finite-dimensional model (no agg. shocks, have idiosyncratic shocks)
# Step 3: Compute the agg. dynamics of th finite-dimensional model using Taylor expansion around the stationary eqm.
